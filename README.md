# portfolio
Updated main portfolio to have it ready for potential job inquiries/interviews

I have created and updated a past portfolio that I've started at the beginning of the course. The portfolio page includes different browsable pages that a user can go through. In this portfolio, i have included an "About Me" section, alongside a "Contact" and "Portfolio" section. There are included links that do work and navigate throughout the web page. Certain link lead to created projects while others lead to LinkedIn pages and GitHub pages. 

I would need to improve more of the mobile side of the page as in mobile it does not reduce how i wanted it to reduce. 

Portfolio section has the attached links to redirect a user to the appropriate page links to either view the deployed site or the code on GitHub.

About me just gives a small, quick run down on who I am and what I am more proficent in terms on langauges. Short and simple. Minor detail that im trying to figure out is the bullet points (list items) that I have inputed. They are not aligining up to what i wanted them to display like.

Contacts has all the link listed to where a user can navigate through and click on a link to redirect them to the proposed website (LinkedIn, GitHub, GoogleDocs). Minor detail that needs dome work is centering the contacts box...its slightly off-centered. Future fix.
